# Required Instructions to Follow

Always work inside the projectâ€™s root venv/.venv, fix existing code end-to-end and iterate until verified before adding new helpers or dependencies; keep solutions terse and elegant; never add silent fallbacks or hide exceptions; prefer AST-aware diffs when reviewing and authoring changes.
