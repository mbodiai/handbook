# Runbooks

Runbooks are operational procedures that provide step-by-step instructions for common tasks, troubleshooting, and incident response.

## What are Runbooks?

Runbooks contain:

- **Standard Procedures** - Step-by-step instructions for routine tasks
- **Troubleshooting Guides** - How to diagnose and fix common issues
- **Incident Response** - Procedures for handling emergencies
- **Maintenance Tasks** - Regular operational activities

## Why We Use Runbooks

- **Consistency** - Ensure tasks are performed the same way every time
- **Knowledge Sharing** - Capture tribal knowledge in accessible format
- **Faster Response** - Reduce time to resolution during incidents
- **Training** - Help new team members learn operational procedures
- **Reliability** - Reduce human error through clear instructions

## Runbook Categories

### System Operations
- Deployment procedures
- Database maintenance
- Backup and recovery
- Performance monitoring
- Scaling operations

### Incident Response
- Service outages
- Performance degradation
- Security incidents
- Data corruption
- Network issues

### Development Operations
- Environment setup
- CI/CD troubleshooting
- Code deployment
- Testing procedures
- Release management

### Monitoring & Alerting
- Alert response procedures
- Log analysis
- Metric interpretation
- Dashboard maintenance
- Notification management

## Creating Runbooks

### When to Create a Runbook

- **Recurring Tasks** - Procedures performed regularly
- **Complex Processes** - Multi-step operations with dependencies
- **Critical Procedures** - Tasks that must be done correctly
- **Knowledge Transfer** - Documenting expert knowledge
- **Incident Response** - Emergency procedures

### Writing Guidelines

- **Be Specific** - Include exact commands and parameters
- **Test Instructions** - Verify procedures work as documented
- **Include Screenshots** - Visual aids for complex UIs
- **Explain Why** - Context helps with troubleshooting
- **Keep Updated** - Review and update regularly
- **Use Clear Language** - Write for someone unfamiliar with the task

### Review Process

1. **Technical Review** - Verify accuracy of procedures
2. **Usability Testing** - Have someone else follow the runbook
3. **Stakeholder Approval** - Get sign-off from relevant teams
4. **Regular Updates** - Schedule periodic reviews

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Runbooks

- **Start with the End Goal** - Clearly state what success looks like
- **Assume No Prior Knowledge** - Write for the least experienced user
- **Include Error Handling** - What to do when things go wrong
- **Provide Context** - Explain why steps are necessary
- **Use Consistent Formatting** - Follow the template structure
- **Include Verification Steps** - How to confirm each step worked

### Maintaining Runbooks

- **Version Control** - Track changes over time
- **Regular Reviews** - Schedule quarterly reviews
- **Update After Incidents** - Improve procedures based on real experiences
- **Gather Feedback** - Ask users for improvement suggestions
- **Remove Obsolete Content** - Archive outdated procedures
