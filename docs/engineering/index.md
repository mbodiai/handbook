# Engineering

Welcome to the Engineering section of the Mbodi Handbook.

This section contains technical documentation, processes, and guidelines for our engineering team.

## Contents

- [ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)](adr/index.md) - Key architectural decisions and their rationale
- [RFCs (Request for Comments)](rfcs/index.md) - Technical proposals and design discussions
- [Runbooks](runbooks/index.md) - Operational procedures and troubleshooting guides

## Engineering Principles

Our engineering practices are guided by these core principles:

### üèóÔ∏è Build for Scale

- **Modular Architecture** - Design systems that can grow and evolve
- **Performance First** - Optimize for speed and efficiency from the start
- **Fault Tolerance** - Build systems that gracefully handle failures
- **Horizontal Scaling** - Design for distributed, scalable architectures

### üî¨ Research-Driven Development

- **Scientific Method** - Apply rigorous experimentation to engineering decisions
- **Reproducible Results** - Ensure our systems and experiments can be replicated
- **Evidence-Based Choices** - Use data and benchmarks to guide technical decisions
- **Open Source Contribution** - Share our learnings with the broader community

### üõ°Ô∏è Security & Reliability

- **Security by Design** - Build security into every layer of our systems
- **Comprehensive Testing** - Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing strategies
- **Monitoring & Observability** - Instrument everything for visibility and debugging
- **Disaster Recovery** - Plan for and practice failure scenarios

### üöÄ Developer Experience

- **Clear Documentation** - Write documentation that helps others understand and contribute
- **Automation** - Automate repetitive tasks to focus on high-value work
- **Code Quality** - Maintain high standards through reviews and tooling
- **Continuous Learning** - Stay current with new technologies and best practices

## Development Process

### Code Review Process

1. **Create Feature Branch** - Work on focused, atomic changes
2. **Write Tests** - Ensure new code is well-tested
3. **Submit PR** - Clear description of changes and rationale
4. **Peer Review** - At least one engineer reviews all changes
5. **CI/CD Pipeline** - Automated testing and quality checks
6. **Deploy** - Controlled rollout with monitoring

### Technology Stack

Our current technology stack includes:

- **Languages** - Python, Rust, TypeScript
- **ML/AI** - PyTorch, JAX, Transformers
- **Infrastructure** - Kubernetes, Docker, AWS/GCP
- **Databases** - PostgreSQL, Redis, Vector DBs
- **Monitoring** - Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry

### Standards & Guidelines

- **Code Style** - Follow language-specific style guides and linting rules
- **Git Workflow** - Feature branches with clear, atomic commits
- **Documentation** - Code comments, API docs, and architectural overviews
- **Testing** - Comprehensive test coverage with clear test strategies

## Getting Started

New engineers should:

1. Complete the [onboarding checklist](../people/index.md)
2. Set up the development environment
3. Read through our [ADRs](adr/index.md) to understand key decisions
4. Review active [RFCs](rfcs/index.md) to understand current discussions
5. Familiarize yourself with our [runbooks](runbooks/index.md)

## Resources

- **Internal Tools** - Links to development and deployment tools
- **External Resources** - Recommended reading and learning materials
- **Community** - Engineering team chat channels and meeting schedules
