# RFCs (Request for Comments)

Request for Comments (RFCs) are technical proposals that describe new features, processes, or significant changes to our systems.

## What are RFCs?

RFCs are detailed design documents that:

- **Propose Solutions** - Describe how to solve a specific problem
- **Gather Feedback** - Allow the team to review and improve proposals
- **Build Consensus** - Help align the team on technical direction
- **Document Design** - Serve as reference during implementation

## When to Write an RFC

Consider writing an RFC when:

- Proposing a new system or major component
- Making significant changes to existing systems
- Introducing new technologies or frameworks
- Establishing new processes or conventions
- Making decisions that affect multiple teams

## RFC Template

```markdown
# RFC-XXXX: [Title]

## Summary

[Brief description of the proposal]

## Motivation

[Why is this change needed? What problem does it solve?]

## Detailed Design

[Comprehensive description of the proposed solution]

### Architecture

[System architecture and component interactions]

### Implementation Plan

[How will this be implemented? What are the phases?]

### API/Interface Changes

[What APIs or interfaces will change?]

## Alternatives Considered

[What other approaches were considered and why were they rejected?]

## Risks and Mitigation

[What could go wrong? How will we address potential issues?]

## Testing Strategy

[How will we test this? What are the success criteria?]

## Migration Strategy

[How will we transition from the current state?]

## Timeline

[What are the key milestones and deadlines?]

## Open Questions

[What questions remain to be resolved?]
```

## Active RFCs

*RFCs will be listed here as they are created*

## RFC Process

### Lifecycle

1. **Draft** - Author creates initial RFC
2. **Review** - Team provides feedback and suggestions
3. **Revision** - Author incorporates feedback
4. **Approval** - RFC is accepted for implementation
5. **Implementation** - Development work begins
6. **Completion** - RFC is marked as implemented

### Creating an RFC

1. **Start with the Problem** - Clearly define what you're trying to solve
2. **Research Existing Solutions** - Look at how others have solved similar problems
3. **Draft the RFC** - Use the template above
4. **Share Early** - Get informal feedback before formal review
5. **Submit for Review** - Post in engineering channels for team review
6. **Iterate** - Incorporate feedback and refine the proposal
7. **Seek Approval** - Get sign-off from relevant stakeholders

### Review Guidelines

When reviewing RFCs, consider:

- **Problem Clarity** - Is the problem well-defined?
- **Solution Completeness** - Does the proposal address all aspects?
- **Technical Soundness** - Is the approach technically viable?
- **Alternatives** - Were other options adequately considered?
- **Risks** - Are potential issues identified and addressed?
- **Implementation** - Is the plan realistic and achievable?

## RFC Categories

- **Architecture** - System design and structure
- **Features** - New product capabilities
- **Infrastructure** - Platform and tooling improvements
- **Process** - Development and operational procedures
- **Research** - Experimental approaches and investigations

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective RFCs

- **Start with Why** - Clearly articulate the problem and motivation
- **Be Specific** - Provide concrete examples and details
- **Consider Edge Cases** - Think through unusual or error scenarios
- **Plan for Scale** - Consider how the solution will handle growth
- **Include Diagrams** - Visual representations help clarify complex ideas
- **Reference Standards** - Link to relevant specifications and best practices

### Review Best Practices

- **Ask Questions** - Seek clarification on unclear points
- **Suggest Improvements** - Offer constructive alternatives
- **Consider Implications** - Think about broader system impacts
- **Be Respectful** - Provide feedback that's helpful and kind
- **Focus on Technical Merit** - Evaluate based on technical criteria

## Templates and Examples

*RFC templates will be added here as needed for specific types of proposals.*

*RFCs are a collaborative process. Everyone is encouraged to participate in writing and reviewing RFCs to help shape our technical direction.*
