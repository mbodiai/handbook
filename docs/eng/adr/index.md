# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) document important architectural decisions made during the development of our systems.

## What are ADRs?

ADRs are short documents that capture:

- **Context** - The situation that led to the decision
- **Decision** - What was decided
- **Status** - Proposed, accepted, deprecated, superseded
- **Consequences** - Expected outcomes, both positive and negative

## Why We Use ADRs

- **Historical Record** - Understand why decisions were made
- **Knowledge Transfer** - Help new team members understand the system
- **Decision Quality** - Force us to think through implications
- **Accountability** - Clear ownership of architectural choices

## ADR Template

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: [Title]

## Status

[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-YYYY]

## Context

[Describe the situation that led to this decision]

## Decision

[Describe the decision that was made]

## Consequences

### Positive
- [List expected benefits]

### Negative
- [List expected drawbacks or risks]

### Neutral
- [List other implications]
```

## Active ADRs

*ADRs will be listed here as they are created*

## Process

### Creating an ADR

1. **Identify the Decision** - Recognize when an architectural decision needs documentation
2. **Draft the ADR** - Use the template above
3. **Review & Discussion** - Share with the engineering team for feedback
4. **Finalize** - Update status to "Accepted" once the decision is made
5. **Index** - Add to this page for discoverability

### Updating ADRs

- ADRs should not be changed once accepted
- If a decision changes, create a new ADR that supersedes the old one
- Mark the old ADR as "Superseded by ADR-XXXX"

### ADR Numbering

- Use sequential numbering: ADR-0001, ADR-0002, etc.
- Include the number in the filename: `adr-0001-example-decision.md`

## Categories

ADRs typically fall into these categories:

- **System Architecture** - Overall system design decisions
- **Technology Choices** - Programming languages, frameworks, tools
- **Data Architecture** - Database design, data flow, storage decisions
- **Security Architecture** - Authentication, authorization, encryption
- **Infrastructure** - Deployment, scaling, monitoring decisions
- **API Design** - Interface contracts and protocols

## Best Practices

- **Write for the Future** - Assume readers don't have current context
- **Be Specific** - Avoid vague language and provide concrete details
- **Include Alternatives** - Mention options that were considered but rejected
- **Keep It Concise** - ADRs should be readable in 5-10 minutes
- **Link to Resources** - Reference relevant documentation, RFCs, or external sources

*This section will grow as we make and document architectural decisions. All engineers are encouraged to contribute ADRs for significant decisions.*
