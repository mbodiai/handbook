## PRD Process

Our PRD process follows these steps:

1. **Problem Definition** - Identify user problems and business needs
2. **Solution Design** - Propose solutions and alternatives
3. **Requirements Gathering** - Define detailed functional requirements
4. **Review & Approval** - Stakeholder review and sign-off
5. **Implementation Planning** - Break down into engineering tasks
6. **Tracking & Updates** - Monitor progress and update as needed

## PRD Template

All PRDs should include:

- **Executive Summary** - High-level overview
- **Problem Statement** - What problem are we solving?
- **Goals & Success Metrics** - How will we measure success?
- **User Stories** - Who will use this and how?
- **Functional Requirements** - What should the product do?
- **Non-Functional Requirements** - Performance, security, etc.
- **Design Mockups** - Visual representations
- **Technical Considerations** - Architecture and implementation notes
- **Timeline** - Development milestones
- **Risks & Mitigation** - Potential issues and solutions
