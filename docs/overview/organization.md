# How We're Organized

We're a team of engineers and researchers making robots as easy to teach as software. Our structure is simple: small teams tackling hard problems in perception, learning, and real-world deployment.

## Organizational Principles

### Flat & Flexible

- Minimal hierarchical layers to reduce communication overhead
- Cross-functional teams organized around projects and outcomes
- Decision-making authority distributed to those closest to the work

**What this means day-to-day:**

- Anyone can talk to anyone - there's no "chain of command" to follow
- Team leads document technical decisions made and look to communicate them in sync meetings.
- We measure success by outcomes, not by how many meetings you attend

### Teams Own Their Mission

Each team exists to solve real problems - whether that's pushing the boundaries of embodied AI research or making sure our customers succeed.

**How we work:**

- Teams have full ownership of their area - from strategy to execution
- Clear goals, but freedom to figure out how to achieve them
- Weekly sync

### Science Drives Everything

We're building AI systems that will work in the real world. That means we can't cut corners on rigor. Every technical decision gets peer review, every research finding gets shared openly, and every assumption gets tested.

**In practice:**

- Weekly research shares where teams present findings
- Open access to all research data and results
- Healthy debate is encouraged - the best idea wins

#### Research (RES)

**Mission**: Make robots see and understand like humans do

- Fundamental research in embodied intelligence
- Publication of scientific papers and open-source contributions
- Collaboration with academic and industry partners
- Technical advisory to other teams

#### Engineering (ENG)

**Mission**: Build robust, scalable AI systems for real-world deployment

- Platform development and infrastructure
- Production system implementation
- Technical integration and deployment
- Code quality and system architecture

#### Business (BUSN)

**Mission**: Drive business growth and market development

- Business strategy and partnerships
- Customer relationships and sales
- Market analysis and competitive intelligence
- Go-to-market planning and execution

#### Finance (FIN)

**Mission**: Financial management and business operations

- Financial planning and analysis
- Budgeting and cost management
- Investor relations and fundraising
- Legal and compliance oversight

#### PR (PR)

**Mission**: External communications and brand management

- Public relations and media outreach
- Content creation and marketing
- Community engagement and developer relations
- Brand positioning and messaging

#### Admin (ADM)

**Mission**: Administrative support and operational efficiency

- Administrative tasks and coordination
- Process optimization and documentation
- Meeting coordination and logistics
- General operational support

#### ML Systems (MLS)

**Mission**: Machine learning infrastructure and real-time perception systems

- ML systems from data ingestion to deployment
- Training, evaluation, and model registry
- Real-time perception and skill learning
- Self-supervision and continuous feedback loops

## Communication Structure

### Regular Meetings

**All-Hands Meeting** (Monthly)

- Company updates and strategic direction
- Team highlights and achievements
- Q&A with leadership
- Recognition and celebrations


### Decision-Making Authority

**Strategic Decisions** (Leadership Team)

- Company vision and mission changes
- Major resource allocation and hiring
- Partnership agreements and contracts
- Product strategy and market positioning

**Technical Decisions** (Engineering + Research)

- Architecture and technology choices
- Research priorities and directions
- Development processes and tools
- Quality standards and practices

**Product Decisions** (Product + Engineering)

- Feature prioritization and roadmap
- User experience and design choices
- Customer requirements and feedback integration
- Release planning and go-to-market strategy

## What's Next

### Near Term (Next 6 Months)

We're heads down on making our ABB pilot a massive success. That means:

- Getting our perception stack to "boring reliability" - 99.9% uptime
- Shipping the teaching interface that factory workers actually want to use  
- Building out our ML systems team (we're hiring!)
- Moving from "demo magic" to "runs all shift without intervention"

### Medium Term (End of 2026)

- Deploy to 2 customer sites, learn what breaks in the real world
- Open source more of our core tools (embodied-agents is just the start)
- Build the data flywheel - every robot deployment makes the next one smarter
- Probably need a real HR person at this point

### By End of 2027 (2-3 Years)

A robot shipping mbodi is a selling point to customers and integrators due to brand awareness and testimonials.
