# How We Communicate

Whatever's in your head, write it down somewhere and share it. Ask for help constantly or clarification if you are stuck for 30 min or more.

## Communication Principles

### Linear-First Documentation

- Every stack trace error must be documented in Linear with full context
- All new research results and findings require Linear issues with visualizations
- Update Linear immediately when encountering bugs, errors, or unexpected behavior
- Include detailed descriptions and reproduction steps in Linear issues
- Attach screenshots, logs, and data visualizations to Linear issues

### Transparency by Default

- Share information openly unless there's a specific reason not to
- Make decisions and reasoning visible to the entire team
- Document important discussions and outcomes in Linear
- Provide context for decisions and changes with proper issue tracking

### Written First with Linear Integration

- Document important information in writing for future reference
- Create Linear issues for all actionable items and findings
- Use asynchronous communication to respect different time zones and work styles
- Create searchable records of decisions and discussions through Linear and PRs

### Purpose-Driven with Tracking

- Be clear about the purpose and expected outcomes of communications
- Create Linear issues to track follow-up actions and commitments
- Choose the right medium for the message and audience
- Respect people's time and attention
- Every communication should result in trackable Linear updates when actionable

### Inclusive & Respectful

- Ensure all team members can participate regardless of location or schedule
- Use clear, jargon-free language when possible
- Provide multiple ways for people to contribute and ask questions
- Foster psychological safety for open dialogue
- Document accessibility considerations in Linear issues

## Communication Channels

### Linear (Primary Project Management)

- All work items tracked as Linear issues
- Project organization and roadmap planning
- Custom workflows for different types of work
- Integration with GitHub for development workflow

### Handbook (Knowledge Base & Documentation)

- Processes, policies, and procedures
- Research findings and methodologies
- Keep all documentation current and accurate
- Link between related concepts and pages

### Slack (Real-time Discussion)

- **#general** - Company-wide announcements and discussions
- **#research** - Research team collaboration
- **#engineering** - Engineering team coordination
- **#product** - Product development and strategy
- **#random** - Casual conversation and team building
- **#alerts** - System monitoring and notifications

### Supporting Tools

- **Email** - Formal external communication with customers, partners, and vendors
- **GitHub** - Code collaboration and technical discussions
- **Video Calls** - Face-to-face interaction for meetings and demos

## Workflow Integration

### Linear → Handbook → Slack Flow

1. **Start in Linear**: Create issues and plan work
2. **Document in Handbook**: Capture knowledge and decisions
3. **Discuss in Slack**: Real-time coordination and updates
4. **Update Linear**: Reflect progress and completion

### Cross-Platform Linking

- Link Linear issues in Slack discussions
- Reference Handbook pages in Linear descriptions
- Connect GitHub PRs to Linear issues
- Maintain context across all platforms

## Meeting Guidelines

### Meeting Types

- **Standup Meetings** (Daily, 15 minutes) - Review Linear board and current sprint
- **Sprint Planning** (Weekly, 1 hour) - Plan upcoming work and priorities
- **All-Hands** (Monthly, 1 hour) - Company updates and strategic direction
- **Research Reviews** (Bi-weekly, 1 hour) - Present research findings and progress

### Meeting Best Practices

**Before the Meeting**: Create agenda in Handbook with Linear issue links
**During the Meeting**: Follow the agenda, take notes in Handbook, create Linear issues for action items
**After the Meeting**: Update Handbook with meeting notes within 24 hours

## What to Document Where

### Update Linear For

**Errors and Issues:**

- Stack traces with full error context and environment details

- Performance issues with metrics and profiling data
- Integration failures with API responses and configuration details

**Research Results:**

- Experimental findings with data visualizations and statistical analysis
- Model performance metrics with charts and comparison tables
- Literature review summaries with key insights and citations
- Prototype results with screenshots, videos, and performance data

**Work Progress:**

- Daily progress updates with specific accomplishments
- Blockers encountered with detailed descriptions and potential solutions
- Time estimates and actual time spent on tasks
- Dependencies identified and their impact on timeline

**DO NOT Update Linear For:**

- General process documentation
- Company policies and procedures
- Long-form technical guides
- Historical context and background information

### Update Handbook For

**Process Documentation:**

- Step-by-step procedures and workflows
- Best practices and coding standards
- Onboarding guides and training materials
- Tool setup and configuration instructions

**Knowledge Base:**

- Research methodologies and frameworks
- Technical architecture and system design
- Company policies and guidelines
- Reference materials and resources

**DO NOT Update Handbook For:**

- Specific bug reports or error instances
- Individual task progress or status updates
- Time-sensitive information that changes frequently
- Personal work logs or daily updates

## Documentation Standards

### Handbook Organization

- **Process Documentation** - How to perform common tasks and procedures
- **Technical Documentation** - API documentation and integration guides
- **Project Documentation** - Project requirements and specifications linked to Linear

### Writing Guidelines

- Use clear headings and organization
- Write for your audience's knowledge level
- Keep documents up-to-date and accurate
- Link to relevant Linear issues and reference related Handbook pages

## Remote Work Communication

### Virtual Collaboration Tools

- Use Handbook for shared documentation and real-time collaboration
- Reference Linear issues during video calls

### Presence and Availability

- Update your Slack status to indicate availability
- Use Linear to track your current work and availability

## Feedback Culture

### Giving and Receiving Feedback

- Document feedback in Linear issues when work-related
- Use Handbook for process and procedural feedback
- Listen actively and follow up on action items

### Continuous Improvement

- Regular team retrospectives documented in Handbook
- Use Linear to track improvement initiatives
- Anonymous feedback channels in Slack for sensitive topics

## Emergency Communication

### Incident and Crisis Response

- Create urgent Linear issues for incident tracking
- Use #alerts Slack channel for immediate notifications
- Document incident response in Handbook
- Designated spokespeople documented in Handbook
