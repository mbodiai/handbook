# How We Work

We try to build great products while being decent humans to each other.

## Keep Asking Questions

The best way to solve problems is to understand them first.

- **Ask why things are the way they are** - Don't assume the first answer is right. Dig deeper
- **Ask questions constantly** - If something's unclear, ask immediately. Better to clarify now than guess wrong later
- **Share what you figure out** - Write down what you learn so others don't have to rediscover it
- **Document everything** - Use Linear as your scratch pad for discussions, questions, and working notes. Polish important decisions into the handbook
- **Change your mind when you're wrong** - Admit when new information proves you wrong and update your approach
- **Talk about what you're learning** - Share your progress and dead ends so the team learns with you

### Care About Results

We judge work by what gets done, not how long it takes.

- **Work wherever and whenever** - As long as you deliver, we don't care about office hours
- **Do a few things well** - Better to nail one important thing than half-ass ten things
- **Know what success looks like** - Figure out the goal before you start working
- **Ship, learn, improve** - Get stuff out there, see what works, make it better

### Work as a Team

Good work comes from people helping each other, not going it alone.

- **Be open about what's going on** - Share problems and progress. Hidden information wastes time
- **Listen to different opinions** - Great ideas can come from anywhere. Ask people who aren't like you
- **Give real feedback** - Tell people what's working and what isn't. Be direct but not mean
- **Help each other win** - When someone succeeds, we all benefit

### Think Big, Execute Well

We want to do ambitious things, but we do them carefully.

- **Have big goals, start small** - Dream about changing the world, but test your ideas step by step
- **Pay attention to details** - The little things matter. Check your work
- **Launch before it's perfect** - Get user feedback early, even if it's not polished
- **Follow through** - See things through to completion, don't just start them

### Learn From Everything

We treat both wins and screw-ups as chances to get better.

- **Learn from mistakes** - When things go wrong, figure out why and fix the process
- **Push yourself** - Take on work that challenges you, even if it's uncomfortable at first
- **Share knowledge** - When you learn something, teach it to others
- **Get feedback fast** - The quicker we learn, the faster we improve

### Day to Day

- **Start with the goal** - Before diving into work, make sure everyone knows what we're trying to achieve
- **Share progress early** - Show drafts and early versions. Better to get feedback now than later
- **Track what actually matters** - Focus on results, not just staying busy
- **Ask questions nicely** - Challenge ideas when they're not working, but don't attack people

### When Hiring & Growing

- **Look for curious people** - We want folks who ask good questions and pick things up quickly
- **Reward real impact** - We care about what you deliver, not how many hours you log
- **Talk about getting better** - Reviews are about what you're learning and how you're growing
- **Promote people who help others** - The best leaders are the ones who make their teams better

### When Things Get Hard

- **Turn arguments into discussions** - Disagreements are just different ways of looking at the same problem
- **Fix problems, don't blame people** - When things break, figure out what went wrong and how to prevent it
- **Focus on the work under pressure** - When things get stressful, prioritize getting things done right
- **Adapt and communicate** - When plans change, be upfront about it
