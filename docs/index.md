# Mbodi Handbook

Welcome to the Mbodi Company Handbook! This is our central repository for company information, processes, and guidelines.

The name *mbodi* is derived from *embody*, reflecting our vision to give form to abstract AI capabilities, and the *n-body* problem in physicsâ€”representing our first principles approach to achieving embodied general intelligence.
