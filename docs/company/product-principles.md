# Product Principles

Our product principles guide how we design, build, and deliver AI solutions. These principles ensure consistency across all our products and align with our mission of advancing embodied intelligence.

## Core Product Principles

### Interpretable

**Principle**: Every product feature is grounded in real-world constraints and operational outcomes.

**What this means**:
- We prioritize solutions that work in real environments over purely virtual demos
- Interfaces communicate assumptions and limits clearly
- Features are validated against real-world scenarios, not just synthetic benchmarks

**Examples**:
- Collision-aware motion planning with safe speeds and clearances
- Contact-safe manipulation tuned for fixtures, parts, and tools
- Sensor fusion that accounts for noise, occlusion, and drift

### Scientific Transparency

**Principle**: Our products should be explainable, reproducible, and scientifically rigorous.

**What this means**:
- All AI decisions can be traced back to underlying principles or data
- Our methods are documented and reproducible by others
- We provide uncertainty estimates and confidence intervals

**Examples**:
- Clear documentation of model architectures and training procedures
- Uncertainty quantification in all predictions
- Open-source components where possible

### Progressive Capability

**Principle**: Products should demonstrate continuous improvement and learning capabilities.

**What this means**:
- Systems can adapt and improve through experience
- New capabilities build upon existing foundations
- Performance degrades gracefully when encountering novel situations

**Examples**:
- Online learning from deployment experiences
- Modular architectures that support capability expansion
- Fallback behaviors for out-of-distribution scenarios

### Safety-Critical Reliability

**Principle**: All products must operate safely in real-world environments with human interaction.

**What this means**:
- Safety is designed in from the beginning, not added later
- Systems have multiple layers of safety checks and fallbacks
- Failure modes are predictable and recoverable

**Examples**:
- Formal verification of critical system components
- Redundant safety systems and graceful degradation
- Comprehensive testing in simulation before real-world deployment

### Human-AI Collaboration

**Principle**: Products should augment human capabilities rather than replace human judgment.

**What this means**:
- Humans remain in control of critical decisions
- AI provides insights and recommendations, not mandates
- Interfaces are intuitive and support human understanding

**Examples**:
- Explainable AI that shows reasoning processes
- Human-in-the-loop validation for critical decisions
- Intuitive visualization of AI system state and confidence

## Implementation Guidelines

### Feature Development Process

1. **Operational Validation** - Ensure new features respect real-world constraints and safety envelopes
2. **Scientific Review** - Peer review of technical approaches and assumptions
3. **Safety Analysis** - Comprehensive safety and failure mode analysis
4. **Human Factors** - User experience and human-AI interaction design
5. **Real-World Testing** - Validation in actual deployment environments

### Quality Standards

- **Accuracy**: Performance meets or exceeds established benchmarks
- **Reliability**: Consistent performance across varied conditions
- **Explainability**: Clear reasoning for all system decisions
- **Safety**: Formal safety guarantees where applicable
- **Usability**: Intuitive interfaces for human operators

### Success Metrics

- **Technical Performance**: Benchmark scores and real-world effectiveness
- **User Adoption**: Customer satisfaction and system utilization
- **Scientific Impact**: Publications and community contributions
- **Safety Record**: Incident rates and safety performance
- **Business Value**: Customer outcomes and return on investment
