# OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)

## What are OKRs?

Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) are our goal-setting framework that helps us:

- Align on priorities across the company
- Set ambitious but achievable goals
- Track progress transparently
- Focus on outcomes, not just activities

### Structure

- **Objectives** - Qualitative, inspirational descriptions of what we want to achieve
- **Key Results** - Quantitative, measurable outcomes that indicate success

## Current Quarter OKRs

### Company-Wide Objectives

*OKRs will be populated here at the beginning of each quarter*

## OKR Process

### Quarterly Cycle

1. **Planning (Month 3 of previous quarter)**
   - Leadership sets company-level objectives
   - Teams propose supporting objectives and key results
   - Review and alignment sessions

2. **Execution (Months 1-3 of current quarter)**
   - Weekly check-ins on progress
   - Mid-quarter reviews and adjustments
   - Continuous tracking and updates

3. **Review (End of quarter)**
   - Score key results (0.0 - 1.0 scale)
   - Reflect on learnings and insights
   - Plan improvements for next cycle

### Scoring Guidelines

- **0.7 - 1.0** - Excellent performance
- **0.4 - 0.6** - Good progress with room for improvement  
- **0.0 - 0.3** - Needs attention and course correction

We aim for an average score of 0.6-0.7. If we're consistently scoring 1.0, our goals may not be ambitious enough.

## OKR Best Practices

### Writing Good Objectives

- **Inspirational** - Motivate the team
- **Qualitative** - Describe what good looks like
- **Time-bound** - Clear timeframe (usually quarterly)
- **Actionable** - Team can influence the outcome

### Writing Good Key Results

- **Measurable** - Clear metrics and numbers
- **Achievable** - Stretch goals but not impossible
- **Specific** - No ambiguity about what success means
- **Outcome-focused** - Results, not activities

### Example OKR

**Objective:** Advance the state of embodied AI research

**Key Results:**
- Publish 2 peer-reviewed papers in top-tier AI conferences
- Achieve 15% improvement in benchmark performance on embodied reasoning tasks

## Team OKRs

Each team develops supporting OKRs that ladder up to company objectives:

- **Engineering** - Technical capabilities and platform development
- **Research** - Scientific breakthroughs and publications
- **Product** - User experience and market validation
- **Operations** - Efficiency and scalability improvements

## Historical OKRs

We maintain a record of past OKRs to track our evolution and learn from our goal-setting patterns.
