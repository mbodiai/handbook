# Mission & Vision

## Our Founding Story

Founded in 2024 by ex-Google engineers Sebastian Peralta and Xavier (Tianhao) Chi, mbodi was born from a mission to enhance robotic intelligence while significantly reducing human intervention. 

The name *mbodi* is derived from *embody*, reflecting our vision to give form to abstract AI capabilities, and the *n-body* problem in physics—representing our first principles approach to achieving embodied general intelligence. 

Bringing deep expertise in large-scale systems and AI to industrial robotics, our founders previously managed Google's Public DNS (8.8.8.8), the world's largest DNS resolver, giving them unique insights into building reliable, scalable AI systems.

## Mission Statement

**Our mission is to enable robots to learn like humans do - through observation, instruction, and experience.**

Just as humans can watch someone perform a task, receive verbal guidance, and quickly adapt to new situations, we're building robots that learn naturally from demonstrations and language. This eliminates the traditional barriers of complex programming, extensive data collection, and specialized machine learning expertise—enabling everyday operators to teach robots new skills as easily as they would teach a colleague.

## Vision

**To make robots as easy to teach and adapt as software, turning them into true consumer commodities and making automation accessible to every factory and beyond.**

We believe that integrating current technologies—vision language models, computer vision, and cloud computing—to work cohesively and improve over time will create comprehensive solutions that unlock new markets.

## Our Technology

### Human-Like Learning
Our platform enables robots to learn through the same mechanisms humans use:

- **Observation**: Robots learn by watching demonstrations, understanding spatial relationships and movement patterns
- **Instruction**: Natural language commands guide robot behavior without complex programming
- **Experience**: Robots adapt and improve through real-world interaction and feedback
- **Generalization**: Skills learned in one context transfer to new situations, just like human learning

### The Central Nervous System for Robots
At the heart of our platform is an advanced agent orchestration system that coordinates all AI models and hardware/sensor information—functioning as the **Central Nervous System for robots**. This enables:

- **Real-time processing**: Converting voice commands to robot actions instantly
- **Reliable execution**: Proprietary spatial Vision Language Model minimizes hallucinations
- **Seamless integration**: Works with existing robotics systems and workflows
- **Continuous learning**: Robots improve performance through ongoing experience
