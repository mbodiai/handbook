# Mission & Vision

## Our Founding Story

Founded in 2024 by ex-Google engineers Sebastian Peralta and Xavier (Tianhao) Chi, mbodi was born from a mission to enhance robotic intelligence while significantly reducing human intervention. 

The name *mbodi* is derived from *embody*, reflecting our vision to give form to abstract AI capabilities, and the *n-body* problem in physics—representing our first principles approach to achieving embodied general intelligence. 

Our team brings deep experience in operating large-scale, safety-critical systems and applied AI for physical environments. We build for reliability first, then scale.

## Mission Statement

Our mission is to enable robots to learn like humans do — through observation, instruction, and experience.

Just as humans can watch someone perform a task, receive verbal guidance, and quickly adapt to new situations, we're building robots that learn naturally from demonstrations and language. This eliminates the traditional barriers of complex programming, extensive data collection, and specialized machine learning expertise—enabling everyday operators to teach robots new skills as easily as they would teach a colleague.

## Vision

To make robots as easy to teach and adapt as software, turning them into practical tools for every factory — and beyond.

We believe that integrating current technologies—vision language models, computer vision, and cloud computing—to work cohesively and improve over time will create comprehensive solutions that unlock new markets.

## Technology Overview

### Embodied Learning
Robots learn from demonstrations, language, and experience — then reuse those skills across tasks and environments.

- Observation: learn by watching, capturing spatial relations and motion
- Instruction: follow natural-language tasks and constraints without brittle scripts
- Experience: adapt online from successes and failures in the real world
- Generalization: transfer skills across fixtures, lighting, and layouts

### Orchestrated Agent Runtime (the “nervous system”)
An orchestration layer coordinates perception, policy, planning, and control across sensors and hardware — a nervous system for embodied agents.

- Real-time grounding: speech-to-intent to action with low latency
- Spatial reliability: geometric priors and guarded execution reduce hallucinations
- System integration: drop into existing workcells, PLCs, and ROS stacks
- Continuous improvement: policies refine with each cycle under safety limits
