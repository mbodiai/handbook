# Values

## How We Work

Our values shape everything we do at Mbodi. They're the practical principles that guide our daily decisions and define our culture.

### Stay Curious, Think Scientifically

We approach every problem with genuine curiosity and rigorous thinking.

- **Ask "why" and "what if"** - Curiosity drives breakthrough discoveries. We encourage questions that challenge assumptions
- **Show your work** - Share evidence, data, and reasoning. Others should be able to follow your thinking and build on it
- **Change your mind with new data** - Strong opinions, loosely held. When evidence contradicts our beliefs, we adapt
- **Learn in public** - Document what you discover. Your learning journey helps others grow too

### Focus on Outcomes, Not Activity

We measure success by impact, not hours worked or tasks completed.

- **Results over presence** - It doesn't matter when or where you work, it matters what you deliver
- **Quality over quantity** - One well-executed solution beats ten half-measures
- **Define success upfront** - Start with clear outcomes. Know what "done" looks like before you begin
- **Iterate based on results** - Ship fast, measure impact, improve continuously

### Build Together

Great solutions come from diverse minds working in harmony.

- **Default to transparency** - Share context, progress, and challenges openly. Information silos slow us down
- **Seek diverse perspectives** - The best ideas often come from unexpected places. Actively invite different viewpoints
- **Give feedback like a gift** - Be direct, kind, and specific. Help others grow through honest conversations
- **Celebrate collective wins** - Individual brilliance is good; team success is better

### Be Thoroughly Bold

We balance bold ambition with meticulous execution.

- **Dream big, start small** - Ambitious vision guides us, but we prove concepts through rapid iteration
- **Sweat the details** - Excellence lives in the details others overlook. Be thorough without being perfectionist
- **Ship to learn** - Perfect is the enemy of good. Get feedback from real users early and often
- **Own the outcome** - Take responsibility for results, not just effort. Follow through until impact is achieved

### Grow Through Everything

Every experience – success or setback – is an opportunity to improve.

- **Embrace productive failure** - Failures are data points, not disasters. Extract lessons and move forward
- **Seek discomfort** - Growth happens at the edge of your comfort zone. Take on challenges that stretch you
- **Teach what you learn** - The best way to solidify knowledge is to share it. Everyone is both teacher and student
- **Optimize for learning velocity** - The faster we learn, the faster we improve. Create tight feedback loops

## Living Our Values

Values only matter if they change behavior. Here's how we make them real:

### In Daily Work

- **Start with why** - Begin meetings and projects by clarifying the outcome we're seeking
- **Share early and often** - Don't wait for perfection. Get feedback while you can still act on it
- **Measure what matters** - Track outcomes, not activities. Know your impact
- **Question respectfully** - Challenge ideas, not people. Curiosity beats criticism

### In Hiring & Growth

- **Hire for curiosity** - Look for people who ask great questions and learn quickly
- **Reward outcomes** - Recognize results and impact, not face time or busy work
- **Growth conversations** - Performance reviews focus on learning velocity and delivered value
- **Promote teachers** - Leaders who develop others embody our values best

### In Tough Moments

- **Conflicts become conversations** - Use disagreements to understand different perspectives
- **Failures become lessons** - Hold blameless postmortems. Focus on systems, not individuals
- **Pressure reveals priorities** - When stressed, we choose outcomes over optics
- **Change brings opportunity** - Adapt quickly, communicate transparently

## Values in Action

Real examples from our team:

**Curiosity in practice**: An engineer's "what if we tried..." question led to a 10x performance improvement in our core algorithm.

**Outcomes over activity**: We cancelled 3 months of work when user research showed we were solving the wrong problem. The pivot led to our most successful feature.

**Thoroughness pays off**: A team member's detailed code review caught a subtle bug that would have affected thousands of users. The extra 30 minutes saved weeks of debugging.

**Learning in public**: After a production incident, the team published a detailed post-mortem that helped three other companies avoid the same issue.

**Collective success**: When one team hit their quarterly goal early, they immediately helped another team that was struggling, ensuring we all succeeded together.

*Our values are living principles. We revisit them quarterly, not to change them lightly, but to ensure they still serve our mission and reflect who we are becoming.*
